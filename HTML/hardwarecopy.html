	<h4 id="HHQ">Motherboard<h4 id="HHA">It's known as the central component of a computer. It's the main circuit board that essentially connects everything
   , and manages everything in order to make one working organism also know as your PC. It also has many characteristics. Motherboards also have various forms, 
  some common ones are "microATX, ATX, and Full ATX"(pss I have an ATX motherboard). The motherboard is usually located on the backside of the computer,
  or at the bottom of the computer case. The motherboard also distributes power to all the pc's hardware but a lot of it goes into powering the CPU, and RAM.
  People consider the 'planar' breadboard released in the 1981 IBM personal computer to be the first motherboard made/created. Over the course of 30 years, 
  the motherboard was revolutionzed and now we have microATX motherboards which are like half the size of an normal sized one, 'ATX'.

  <h4 id="HHQ2">CPU<h4 id="HHA2"> The CPU is short for central processing unit. Its the brain of your computer, it processes, and calculates most if not everything for you. Ranging from hardcore gaming to a simple calculator, or even typing.. It handles all the instructions you give your computer. Compared to the first processor released in 1971, the Intel 4004, is a 4-bit processor rated at 0.092 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) compared to one of the highest rated consumer processors with a whopping 133,740 MIPS. The speed of a processor has increased by almost 133.7 billion instructions per second. Instructions account for retrieving information, breaking it down and translates it into a language that makes sense, then executing the instructions then choosing between three different options, and finally carrying out the task, et. reading a document, opening a program, or sending information back to a program    </h4></h4</div>

<div style="margin-left:60px;">
<h5 id="HHQ3">RAM<h5 id="HHA3"> RAM is short for random access memory,it obviously stores information temporarily it stores information temporarily for when you want to access it later, and but if you turn off the computer or if it happens to die/lose power then the information disappears but on the flip side it makes loading up information, program, .exes, photos, system processing.. BASICALLY EVERYTHING immensely faster. </h5>

    <h6 id="HHQ4">Hard Drive<h6 id="HHA4"> A hard drive is a storage device, it can seek, read and write information. It stores information permanently, and it contains things like your OS (operating system) and your system programs for instance something like Skype!</h6>

    <h7 id="HHQ5">Communication between different computer parts </h7><h7 id="HHA5">Computer components communicate with each other through thin connections called buses on the motherboard. The devices follow a protocol called IEEE. Protocols are different based off of the bus and device. Multiple devices can connect to the same bus and they are communicated through things called bus controllers. Devices that dont involve the usage of the CPU and RAM also communicate directly with other devices are called bus mastering devices.</h7>

    <h8 id="HHQ6"> Peripherals</h8><h8 id="HHA6"> A keyboard is piece of computer peripheral or hardware that mainly inputs text, characters, or other commands into a computer. The standard keyboard type is QWERTY, PS I have one of those! A keyboard is a key component to a computer. But anyways.. How would you have gotten to this site if you didnt have a keyboard! 
A mouse is a hand operated device/peripheral that controls the movement of the pointer/cursor on the monitor or display screen. The buttons on the mouse allow you to interact with software elements, windows, files, and programs like Google Chrome. A monitor is a piece of hardware that displays the video and graphics information sent from your video card or computer. You need a monitor to even use the computer or see anything sent by the computer. </h8>
