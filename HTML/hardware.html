        <p id="moboInfo"> It's known as the central component of a computer. It's the main circuit board that essentially connects everything , and manages everything in order to make one working organism also know as your PC. The motherboard is usually located on the
            backside of the computer, or at the bottom of the computer case. The motherboard also distributes power to all the pc's hardware but a lot goes into powering the CPU, RAM, and the video card.
            <br>FUN FACT: The 'planar' breadboard released in the 1981 IBM personal computer was the first motherboard made/created. Over the course of 30 years, the motherboard has been revolutionzed, from wanting features to having too many. </p>

        <p id="cpuInfo"> The CPU is short for central processing unit. Its the brain of your computer, it processes, and calculates most if not everything for you. Ranging from hardcore gaming to a simple calculator, or even typing.. It handles all the instructions you
            give your computer. A high-end cpu in todays market compared to the first processor released in 1917, the Intel 4004, is 133.7 billion instructions per second faster. Instructions essentially mean the retrieving, breaking down, translating,
            executing, and sending of the information back.
            <!--The speed of a processor has increased by 133.7 billion instructions per second comparing a modern day top of the line consumer cpu to the first cpu. Instructions account for retrieving information, breaking it down and translating it into a language that makes sense, then executing the instructions then choosing between three different options, and finally carrying out the task, et. reading a document, opening a program, or sending information back to a program-->

        <p id="ramInfo">RAM is short for random access memory.<br>It stores information temporarily for when you want to access it later, but if you turn off the computer or if it happens to die/lose power then the information disappears but on the flip side it makes
            loading up information, programs, .exes, photos, system processing.. BASICALLY EVERYTHING immensely faster.</p>

        <p id="busInfo">Computer components communicate with each other through thin connections called buses on the motherboard. The devices follow protocol IEEE. Protocols are different based off of the bus and device. Multiple devices can connect to the same bus,
            they communicate through things called bus controllers. Devices that dont involve the usage of the CPU and RAM but also communicate directly with other devices are called bus mastering devices.</p>
